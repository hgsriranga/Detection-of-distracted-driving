Here, there is a guide to use the code

Step1 : Open the file 'YOLOv3_distractions_final.py'. In order for this code to work, copy the files 'yolov3_custom_last_4000.weights'

and 'yolov3_custom_final.cfg'. Finally specify the path of images, which has to be detected.

Step2 (Training) : The training can be performed online. Upload the file 'YOLOv3_Tutorial.ipynb' in Training folder onto Google collab

and execute each line of code. In the end, the weights file needed after training will be saved  in google drive which could be downloaded.

Step 3 (Labelling) : Run the software available in the folder Labelling for labelling custom dataset. The tool is simple and self explanatory.


Step 4 : Additional files

Obj.names - To be used during training containing all the classes of data trained

yolov3_custom_final.cfg - Configuration file containing all the information about the algorithm, parameters can be changed here for better 

training.
